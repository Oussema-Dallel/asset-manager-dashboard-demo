# ModelViewer

This component is used to display a 3D model of type `splat` in the browser. It uses the [react-three](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) library to render the model.

## How to integrate and use

To integrate this component into your application, you need to do the following:

```tsx
<Viewer modelSrc={ output3d } />
```

Where `output3d` is the URL of the 3D model.
